# DiamondOps Evidence Pack (Canonical)

This document provides a **verifiable evidence index** demonstrating the
documentation-only posture, governance model, and liability boundaries of the
DiamondOps ecosystem.

This file is **canonical** and maintained in **DiamondOps-Core**. Downstream
repositories may reference it but must not modify it.

---

## 1. Documentation-Only Posture

DiamondOps produces **documentation, schemas, and validation artifacts only**.

DiamondOps does **not**:
- manufacture equipment
- install equipment
- operate equipment
- maintain equipment
- control physical systems

**Canonical source:**
- Position Statement
  https://github.com/stegverse-labs/diamondops-core/blob/main/docs/POSITION.md

---

## 2. Liability Boundary

DiamondOps responsibility is strictly limited to the **correctness of technical
determinations and documentation at time of issuance**.

All physical responsibility remains with:
- asset owners
- OEMs
- installers
- operators

**Canonical source:**
- Liability Boundary
  https://github.com/stegverse-labs/diamondops-core/blob/main/docs/LIABILITY_BOUNDARY.md

---

## 3. Canonical Governance & Enforcement

Canonical documents are:
- authored in **DiamondOps-Core**
- registered and enforced by **StegDB**
- propagated downstream via automated PRs

Downstream repositories:
- may not edit canonical documents
- must accept updates via StegDB automation

**Evidence:**
- StegDB canonical sync workflow
  https://github.com/stegverse-labs/stegdb/actions/workflows/sync-diamondops-core-canonicals.yml

---

## 4. Scope of Downstream Repositories

Repositories such as HydraSafe, ReactorOps, and YieldOS:
- consume DiamondOps-Core canonicals
- may add repo-specific documentation
- do not expand DiamondOps liability or operational scope

Any discrepancy between a downstream repo and a canonical document must be
resolved in favor of the canonical document.

---

## 5. Intended Use

This Evidence Pack is suitable for:
- insurance underwriting review
- regulatory inquiries
- enterprise customer due diligence
- partner compliance verification

It is not a substitute for contractual terms, but serves as **public,
verifiable proof of platform posture**.

---

## Canonical Status

- **Canonical Source:** DiamondOps-Core
- **Enforced By:** StegDB
- **Modification Policy:** Update here first, then re-sync downstream
